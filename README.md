ML-powered app to detect food and guide pregnant women
# 🤰 What a Pregnant Lady Should Eat – AI Food Detection System

A machine learning-powered web application that detects food items from images and provides dietary advice for pregnant women. Utilizes YOLO object detection integrated with Python and Google Colab to identify foods and classify them as safe, caution, or avoid during pregnancy.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- Google Colab
- OpenCV
- HTML/CSS (basic)
- Google Drive

## 🎯 Project Goal
To assist pregnant women in making informed dietary decisions through AI-powered image analysis.
